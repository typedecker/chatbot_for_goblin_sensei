I LOVE YOU TOOOO	YOU'RE A FUCKING FAIRY
you belong with me	AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
idk sometimes people find out where they belong  really late in their lives	I used to belong with myself
**burrowsb**#0000 <:userphone:650883846581125142> I love you rose	reading is a good habit.
whoa <:gems_bf:1166540340233240656>	ikr
oh	dw not you
hi	heyyy
yo the princess thingy is for shits and giggles if my words actually have a meaning i talk normally	a true princess never shits in front of guys
princesses don't use the skull emoji	exactly
you just gotta take the initiative	I did
drinking black lets me focus as i dont get distracted by the taste	yeah i usually like a strong taste of coffee too
I mainly drink black, but I dont mind having milk and sugar	ah thats nice
i do yes	amazinggg
I got back from the coffee shop..	thts great
I hope everyone is well..	heyy
I can't do anything like that 👍	You can be the idea giver
(I have problems at extracting zip files so yeah )	I had those when I was a kid too
Why did your friend not come  or what-	I've no real friends
but it's also rare to use px nowadays, nothing neccessarily wrong with it but a lot of developers will use 'rem' measurements so ..

```css
.parent {
  height: 8rem;
}

.child {
  height: 50%;
}
```	Oh i see
splendid	Yasss
So 50% on the body tag would be the same as 50vh I believe - but 50% on a child element will be dependant on its parent's size meanwhile 50vh is always the screen	Ohh
how was your exam?	It went amazing
Technically if you use % on the parent element I believe it should have about the same effect, but using vh and vw is more declarative. If you use 50% inside a 200px element then it's height would be 100px	So the vh and vw attributes are based off of the parent's height and width?
Omg you're back did you finish your exam?	Yes
Good morning	Hey Gm!!
You'd load any node code from your main file where you initiate electron itself. You can create mappings to execute node code from the electron browser environment	Ah I see
Not too bad, yesterday I was smashing my head against the wall during work but got it all done now	Yay thats amazing

Discords says that there are people in a VC here but there are none 😦	There are two
The first one I've ever made I think I was in 1st grade?
His name is Nathan	Woah
hi!	HEYYY HRU
I just wanted to know cuz I've never seen anyone space their sentences like
mid sentence
y'know?	alot of people do
why do you space your sentences like that	1. audience retention
2. habit
3. fast typer problems(skill issue for slow typers or those who dont know about dnd tbh)
4. its easier to read in short sentences and the content doesnt seem overwhelming but short and crisp
Nah cuz I thought this place was alive asf when I joined but whatever	it was
Nu
I don't remember 
But they @ -d me and like 2 other people specifically	alr
Lmao 😭
No love him 
He has a girly pop which I love dearly	oh i see
Grim
Said he'd think it fit my vibe
Then just kinda evaporated
Which is normal but whatever	he said u were his wife-
Yeah and I appreciated that
But the fact someone higher up in the server was rude and then immediately went fully standoffish instead of admitting their mistakes and apologizing for being rude and pushy with me when I was already not ok wasn't cool
I'd only talked when I first joined because I joined because of a specific friend I'm not even sure is here anymore
I have nothing against you
I have had nothing against you
But the amount of people is stressful and the fact you keep getting upset about people not talking when they're not comfortable is not cool either :/	who was that
I wanted to be
But I have hella anxiety
The server seemed nice and I wanted to be here
But that wasn't cool
I've tried to interact a couple times after but haven't felt comfortable since that	idk you never rly msged on ur own
Hey man, nothing against ya but like people got lives yk? And sometimes people have things irl to do yk and just because people haven't talked in like 1 day doesn't mean that they are forgetting the server	sometimes
no ones out for you 💀	
It's difficult to wanna talk tbh
Feels forced after a while and the fact someone tried to guilt me into being more active when I was in and out the er wasn't a good incentive to	you were never active to begin with. theres no question about being more active
we understand!!	we understand everything except the owner's issues cuz no one rly cares abt how much stuff he tries to add to improve the server
are you really 100% sure no one from here gives a fuck?	yes
if someone wants to talk they will talk	thats the issue
ppl have lives	yeah thts true and i never asked them to join discord
in your opinion adi, being active means talking here a lot every single day?	no
also I stop by to say hi once in awhile
i just don't do it a lot cuz y'know
school us stressful + I have swim class and I sleep hella early	i have two exams tmrw
I'm at school	tell me smth
Cuz I don't see anybody in this server giving a fuck	same @everyone
what😭	nobody is giving a fuck about the server
I also have another one that I saw in my fyp a few days ago 'mentally sick physically thiccc'	u have tiktok?
I have different	ew

How'd you know I'm a bottom	cuz im at the top duh
I'll fake the be moody about it then : wHaT hoW dAre YoU	epic comeback
Hi front	nah im top
I would rather let the ai transform json to yaml for me on the fly than set all that up myself manually for instance, tens of thousands of devs already use GitHub’s CodePilot which will suggest snippets for you to improve your efficiency as an engineer, I don’t think it’s disrespectful personally, someone who has no previous experience with code however would be a fool thinking that ai is their solution to being a good developer	yes but
I would assume they probably have some type of stack class to do it both vertically and horizontally	they have the column class
Lookup css flexbox	ohh okay
I think ai can be useful but only if you know how code and the logic behind it works in the first place. We had a guy at my job who would mindlessly push broken ai generated code to our testers and got fired	perhaps, but for me, coding is smth i also do for fun, and i feel like it ruins the fun for me to think that anyone who hasnt even tried to learn a technology is tryna just type into a prompt whatever i am working hard to accomplish, just feels so wrong and disrespectful
it can be frustrating but when you are fluent in css ui becomes so much less daunting	well yeah i tried googling for
Mozilla, stackoverflow, w3 are all good ones. I know when I got started I would typically just set my mind to something I wanted visually and then googled my way to the answers	ohh alright
Just practice and repetition, eventually you can just look at a design and imagine it in CSS 😉	no but like i meant tht
I got this from ai	please dont talk abt ai generating code, it hurts my programmer soul
ah cool, I remember using bulma for a hackathon once	i've a doubt
But if i manage to get money tho id sctually gift you nitro	u dont have to
what’ve you been up to	not much tbh tryna learn electron.js and
Yeah it’s been a while, I just got back home from my work trip in England	ohhh nicee
What’s good	HEYY HRU
Poor adi 😭	how
I don't how to put on idle	u dont have to manually do it
yes? im out rn shopping	shop well <33
I didn't forget I just been very busy	idk i saw u online so i thought you must've been free
https://lichess.org/iDapJKd2	^^^^

Why does thr baby look like satoro gojo	hes more powerful than padoru bozo
And ima marry turtle goblin😎	nopee

Bibitty bobitty boo	Yaa boobs
hope your wound healed ;-;	MY MEOWND MEOWED
And this is probably the 5th time I'm saying we were not arguing neither we are arguing rn	The statement "did anyone ask you to?" isnt something that is said in a non argumentative environment
Actually no the rainbow snail is my toy	Its not that imp to me and neither is it imp enough to have a fight over
Theres no other reason why you'd type that tho	You should reread wht u said here
There is no reason to argue with u tho	Well you should understand that then😭
Nuh uhhh	Shut up
Who would name a rainbow snail snow	Its better than ur name
Hahaha victory moment 🤣	Fr
I LOVE U MORE MWAH	ILY THE MOST
What would you name a rainbow snail	Rail
Because I got invested in it to the point it was turning unhealthy	Ohh I see
I love the fact that we can know what happened in the past but i hate the fact that we have to learn the things which are half truths	I mean they just tell us possible theories of wht could've happnd and introduce us to different ideals
I forgot everything I learnt in history	I still remember it hazily
Can you summarise it then?	Thts wht jumbling means tho yk
i dont particularly know, but its history of my country, and theres a lot of specific stuff i have to remember	Yee wht i love abt history is knowing abt it all like a story but wht I hate is when they ask us to learn numbers or names of alot of ppl or treaties and stuff
Jumble out some main words	It won't give the accurate picture
Helloooo wb	Thanks
I scored the highest marks in history, computer and English in my school	Ay nice
Also now ur 4 and half an hour in the future cus we’ve changed to winter time	Ohh
